## Arithmetic Operators   

### Task   
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, _**a**_ and _**b**_. Add code to print three lines where:   
1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.   
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).   
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.   

### Example   
_**a = 3   
b = 5**_   

Print the following:   
```s
8   
-2   
15   
```
### Input Format ###  
The first line contains the first integer, _**a**_.   
The second line contains the second integer, _**b**_.   

### Initial code: ###   
```s
if __name__ == 'main__':   
    a = int(input())   
    b = int(input())   
```
